// the following functions take a 64-bit integer key and return a 32-bit signed 
// integer hash, calculated as ( A * key + B ) % p where p is a large prime.
// p is just under 2^31, so the result of this expression will always be 
// between 0 and 2^31-1 (including accounting for overflows, since the 
// expression is unsigned). therefore, when returned as a 32-bit signed 
// integer, the result will always be non-negative
// 
// when using these functions, remember to modulo by the size of your hash table
// to get a valid address

// first available hash function
int h1(int64 k);
